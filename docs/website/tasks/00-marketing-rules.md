3. **Content Design**: Specific headlines, body copy strategy, and CTAs.
4. **Visual Design System**: Colors, typography, and luxury textures.
5. **Component Specifications**: Functional definitions of custom elements.
6. **Responsive Strategy**: Breakpoint behavior.
7. **Luxury Motion & UX**: Animation logic and "Intelligence Overlays."
8. **Implementation Checklist**: Final verification.
